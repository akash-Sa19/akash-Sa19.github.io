## Summary
<hr>
<mark><i><b> The most creative aspect of a web designer is his portfolio website.</b></i></mark>

The sole purpose of creating this website was to display compelling content and to provide basic information in the way that leads to getting more clients.   

## Introduction
<hr>
At the most basic form, a portfolio website provides professional information about an individual or a company and presents a showcase of their work.<br>
This Report is composed to tell you about the process, methods, and technologies that I use in making this portfolio website.


## Method
<hr>

### Mobile-First Approach
- Mobile-First Approach refers to the practice of designing and/or developing an online experience for mobile before designing for the desktop web or any other device.

### Responsive Web Design
- Responsive web design is about creating web pages that look good on all devices
- A responsive web design will automatically adjust for different screen sizes and viewport

## Process
<hr>

- Goal Identification: To increase web presence and showcase my work to potential clients.
- Scope Definition: To fulfill our goals,  we need the site to have a Resume, Contact, Project, and Hire me section.
- Sitemap and Wireframe creation: With the scope well-defined, we can start digging into the sitemap, defining how the content and feature will interrelate.
- Content Creation: With wireframe created it's time we write the content that will display on the site.
- Visual Element: With the site architecture and some content in place, we can start working on the visual brand.
- Testing: By now, we have got all our pages and defined how they display to the site visitor, so it's time to make sure it all works.
- Launch: Once everything's working beautifully, it's time to plan and execute our site launch! This should include planning both launch timing and communication strategies.

## Technologies
<hr>

- Tailwind CSS: This is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework
- Vite Vue: It's a Front-End Build tool that comes with a dev server, and it bundles your code for production.
- Git and GitHub: Git is a version control tool (software) to track the changes in the source code. GitHub is a web-based cloud service to host your source code(Git repositories). 

## Conclusion 
<hr>
Creating a personal website was the ideal project to start my journey. It allowed me to recall many of the information and design concepts. The process of reviewing and analyzing websites, establishing my design voice, and creating something out of it all was empowering. <br>
Making a portfolio website has also significantly tested my creativity and shown me that there are many career options, design specialties, and avenues for further study awaiting me.
<br>

## Recommendation
<hr>

- It's important to consider Responsive Web Design as there are infinite screen sizes.
- Establish a repository for the project in any Version Control System.
- Leave plenty of comments in the code, for debugging, and code maintenance.
- Go through the user experience before l launching the website.
